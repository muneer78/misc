208902275,Democracy Hacked: Political Turmoil and Information Warfare in the Digital Age,1,"Moore, Martin",Author,,,"Oneworld Publications (2018), 336 pages",2018,"This is a very thorough overview of how the various social media platforms and technology in general have transformed democracy. 

Moore's main thesis is that we as citizens have ceded a great deal of our freedom in exchange for getting ""free entertainment"". Twitter has replaced local media as the place where people get their news. Facebook's statuses have replaced calling or directly interacting with our friends and family. The old forms of communication depended upon us to pull information while the new social media platforms push a deluge of stuff to us. In the end, is it better for us to have information come to us without effort? Do we value it the same as we would if we'd gone out of our way to get it? Moore says no and I agree.

Moore buttresses his points by providing examples of the intersection of tech and government. I was particularly interested in reading about the Aadhaar system in India. Launched in 2012, it had already become an integral part of existing in India when this book was published. That enmeshment into daily life has only continued in the intervening years. Aadhaar had the noble aim to provide services to people who previously weren't able to get them due to not being able to read or write. But instead it's become an Orwellian system where citizens are presumed guilty until establishing their innocence when they're rejected for some public benefit. The Modi government initially opposed Aadhaar, but then saw its potential for control. They've now made it an immovable force that cannot be removed without causing a great deal of chaos. I'd argue that this experiment is a lot like most tech. The proponents fail to see the ways in which their invention can be used to damage society. If Moore ever writes about this topic again, I'd love to see an update of the state of the Aadhaar system.

I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested in how tech can be misused by bad actors.",4,,,Democracy Hacked: Political Turmoil and Information Warfare in the Digital Age by Martin Moore (2018),Hardcover,336 p.; 8.85 inches,1.2 pounds,8.85 inches,1.3 inches,5.75 inches,8.85 x 5.75 x 1.3 inches,336 ,,,,,,,"politics, tech",Anti-Library,,English,JC423 .M678,[1786074087],"[1786074087, 9781786074089]",,321.8073,Education And Research > Political Science  > Political Systems > Republic > Social sciences,,1,amazon.com books,2021-11-25,,,22165824,,,,
